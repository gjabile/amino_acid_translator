Codon sequence Translator
A divide & conquer algorithm to parse biological codon sequences & extract amino acid sequences for protein analysis

Motivation:
When I was taking grade 12 biology in highschool, one of the units involved DNA replication - specifically codon sequences which are groups of 3 nucleotide 
bases that code for a specific amino acid which can be subsequently chained together to form larger protein structures. One of our assignments involved us 
having to translate the codon sequences into amino acid sequences by hand. So, I created this program to expediate this process and make my homework a lot 
easier. 

What did you learn?
The main thing I learned was how to write meaningful and neat code. When I was debugging my code and trying to figure out why I was running into so many errors,
it became exponentially easier when I began organizing my code neatly and adding comments to see the different paths the program can take when it runs. 

Current/Future:
I am currently working on getting the program to access very large data sets & time its run time. Then I plan on trying out different algorithms to see how 
much the run time can be minimized.
